## Project Overview

The **Smart Sales and Inventory Tracker** is a web-based point of sale (POS) system designed to revolutionize how businesses manage their sales, inventory, and customer interactions. By leveraging automation, real-time data tracking, and advanced analytics, this system aims to enhance operational efficiency and decision-making capabilities.
